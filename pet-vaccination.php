                     </h3>
                     <p>Vaccinations (sometimes known as "shots") have saved millions of pets' lives. Pets died from viral and bacterial infectious diseases on a regular basis before the advent of efficient vaccinations. Current vaccination programmes saves life of our dogs (and us) from diseases such as rabies  so, vaccination against such diseases is legal.</p>
                     <p>Puppy and adult dog vaccination recommendations:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>6 – 8 weeks of age: Distemper / Parvo / Hepatitis combination.</li>
                        <li>10 – 12 weeks of age: Distemper/Parvo/Hepatitis combination booster + Bordetella vaccine (Kennel Cough), If the risk of kennel cough is great, i.e. you take your dog to the groomer’s or board them in boarding or doggy daycare facilities</li>
                        <li>Mi14 – 16 weeks of age: Distemper/Parvo/Hepatitis combination booster + Bordetella booster + Rabies (required by the laws of Ontario)
                            Week 20: Vaccination against Leptospirosis (“Racoon Disease”, Dirty Water Disease”) is also available and is recommended if your dog spends time in cottage areas, conservation areas, camping, parks, and is a curious soul investigating water ponds and puddles!!lk</li>
                        <li>22 – 23 weeks of age: Booster for Leptospirosis vaccine</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>1 -2 years of age: Distemper / Parvo / Hepatitis combination (choice of a three – year vaccine) + Rabies (choice of a three – year vaccine)+ Bordetella (if exposed to the groomer’s or boarding facilities)
                        And in 2 weeks time: Leptospirosis vaccination should it still be necessary (see above)</p>
                    <p>Older than 2 years: In the past, the DHPPL (distemper, hepatitis, parvo, parainfluenza, Leptospirosis) combination vaccine was typically given each year. These recommendations are changing. 
                        The American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) came out with new guidelines in 2006 that suggests that adult dog vaccines boosters may be adequate if given every 3 years. It is our responsibility to discuss all of the available options with our valued clients, and individualize the vaccination protocol to the specific needs of their pets. The Bordetella (Kennel Cough) vaccine and the Leptospirosis vaccine may still be necessary annually, again, depending on your dog’s habits and lifestyle.</p>
